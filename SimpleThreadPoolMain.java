 * 
 * A thread pool manages the pool of worker threads, it contains a queue that keeps tasks waiting to get executed. 
 * A thread pool manages the collection of Runnable threads and worker threads execute Runnable from the queue. 
 * java.util.concurrent.Executors provide implementation of java.util.concurrent.Executor interface to create the thread pool in java
 * 
 * we are creating fixed size thread pool of 5 worker threads. Then we are submitting 10 jobs to this pool, 
 * since the pool size is 5, it will start working on 5 jobs and other jobs will be in wait state, 
 * as soon as one of the job is finished, another job from the wait queue will be picked up by worker thread and getâ€™s executed
